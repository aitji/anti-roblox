This is a script that:
- Terminates Roblox Player & Studio
- Removes all files, shortcuts, and temp installers
- Silently runs and adds itself to system startup: `shell:startup`
- Auto-updates from GitHub

> Built for one purpose: clean the system like Roblox never existed.


Requires: Python 3.x, `psutil`, `watchdog`, `numba`, `pywin32`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

you can direct load python module by this below command!

```bash
pip install psutil watchdog numba pywin32
```

## Build Python to EXE

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile anti_roblox.pyw
```

> You should grab "anti_roblox.spec" too
> 
> Output will be at `/dist/anti_roblox.exe`
